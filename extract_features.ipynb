      "Article(topic=Nokia, title=Qualcomm is the latest company to opt to go virtual for Mobile World Congress 2021, description=As of right now, Mobile World Congress 2021 is scheduled to take place, in-person, next month. However, Qualcomm is just the latest company to confirm that it won't have an exhibit at the conference, following in the footsteps of several other major companies including Google, Nokia, Sony, Samsung, Lenovo, and others. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, a Qualcomm spokesperson confirmed that it will be offering a virtual exhibition, similar to what we have seen from recent tech-focused conferences. CES 2021 was the latest of these, offering an all-online conference with users being able to watch presentations from the comfort of their couches, versus diving headfirst into a sticky situation in Las Vegas. “While we appreciate the health and safety measures being put into place by the GSMA for MWC Barcelona, we have decided that it is in the best interest of our employees and customers for Qualcomm’s participation to be virtual this year. We look forward to engaging with the ecosystem through Cristiano Amon’s virtual keynote on June 28th and through our latest announcements and 5G demonstrations.” With so many large and influential companies already opting for virtual conferences instead of being in-person, it could be just a matter of time before the GSMA makes the same decision it had to for last year. Currently, the conference is still being planned as an in-person event with some COVID-19 guidelines to \"help\" the event from becoming a super-spreader event. Namely, GSMA is requiring that attendees must have had a negative COVID test within 72 hours of their arrival. The GSMA also claims that it has \"plans for controlling crowd density\". However, that may not be enough as just one person with COVID could potentially spread to hundreds or thousands of attendees. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out, especially considering that we still have IFA planned for later in the year, along with CES 2022 coming back in January next year. url=https://phandroid.com/2021/05/13/qualcomm-is-the-latest-company-to-opt-for-virtual-for-mobile-world-congress-2021/)\n",

      "Article(topic=Microsoft, title=Bill Gates admits affair with Microsoft employee, denies being forced off Microsoft's board over it, description=Melinda French Gates started talking with divorce lawyers in late 2019, not long after The New York Times reported that Bill Gates had more interactions with pedophile and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that she had known about, the Times and The Wall Street Journal report. But it was also in late 2019 that Microsoft's board became aware of a letter from a Microsoft engineer who said she had been in a sexual relationship with Bill Gates years earlier, the Journal reported Sunday evening. The couple announced their divorce May 3, after 27 years of marriage. Microsoft board members hired a law firm to investigate the woman's allegations and deemed the relationship inappropriate, and by early 2020 \"some board members decided it was no longer suitable for Mr. Gates to sit as a director at the software company he started and led for decades,\" the Journal reports. \"Mr. Gates resigned before the board's investigation was completed and before the full board could make a formal decision on the matter.\" He had just been re-elected to the board in December 2019, three months before his March 13, 2020, resignation. \"There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,\" Bridgitt Arnold, a spokeswoman for Bill Gates, said in a statement. \"Gates' decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.\" Melinda Gates had been upset with her future ex-husband on and off for years, including over a sexual harassment settlement Bill Gates had facilitated for the couple's longtime financial adviser, the Times reports. \"In some circles, Bill Gates had also developed a reputation for questionable conduct in work-related settings,\" and on at least a few occasions he had \"pursued women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\" \"It is not clear how much Ms. French Gates knew about her husband's behavior or to what degree it contributed to their split,\" the Times reports. Arnold, the spokeswoman, told the Times \"it is extremely disappointing that there have been so many untruths published about the cause, the circumstances and the timeline of Bill Gates' divorce.\" She added, \"The rumors and speculation surrounding Gates' divorce are becoming increasingly absurd, and it's unfortunate that people who have little to no knowledge of the situation are being characterized as 'sources.'\" More stories from theweek.comThe threat of civil war didn't end with the Trump presidency7 scathingly funny cartoons about Liz Cheney's ousterBiden reportedly likes a 'low-key' White House url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/bill-gates-admits-affair-microsoft-081005576.html)\n",
